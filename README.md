# Ftp-Uploader-.NET-Core
Console app used to upload files to an FTP directory

## Notes
- Currently only works with regular FTP protocol. I plan to add SFTP and possibly FTPS support later.
- Code can be run either by loading in the source, destination, credentials, and other FTP information from appSettings.json or by prompting the user for that information.

## To Do:
- Add more validation for both user-input values and values loaded in from appSettings.json.
- Add support for FTPS and SFTP.
